# Files often containing secrets or local settings
# Consider if appsettings.Development.json has secrets.
# If so, it should be ignored and secrets managed via User Secrets or environment variables.
# For now, we'll assume it's okay or you'll manage secrets separately.
# If you have local database files like .db that are part of the template but not actual data,
# you might ignore them. Your SQLite DB (datos_aplicacion.db or miaplicacion.db)
# if it's meant to be part of the initial repo (e.g. empty structure), keep it.
# If it contains sensitive data or grows large, consider ignoring it and generating it on run.
# Ejemplo:
# *.db
# !nombre_especifico_de_tu_plantilla_db.db
